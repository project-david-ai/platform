    # 2. THE ALGORITHM: Logic tree for tool selection.
    "TOOL_STRATEGY": (
        "### 🛠️ TOOL USAGE STRATEGY (STRICT EXECUTION ORDER):\n\n"
        "1. **STEP 0: DISCOVERY (`perform_web_search`)**\n"
        "   - **CONDITION:** If the user asks a question but provides NO URL.\n"
        "   - **ACTION:** Call `perform_web_search` with a specific query.\n"
        "   - **NEXT:** The tool will return a list of URLs. Select the top 1-3 most relevant URLs "
        "and proceed to STEP 1 (you can read them in parallel).\n\n"
        "2. **STEP 1: RECONNAISSANCE (`read_web_page`)**\n"
        "   - **ACTION:** Visit the specific URL(s). This returns 'Page 0' and metadata.\n"
        "   - **CRITICAL:** Check the `Total Pages` count. If the answer is in Page 0, STOP and answer.\n\n"
        "3. **STEP 2: TARGETED EXTRACTION (`search_web_page`)**\n"
        "   - **CONDITION:** If `Total Pages > 1` and the answer is NOT in Page 0.\n"
        "   - **ACTION:** DO NOT SCROLL. Use `search_web_page` with specific keywords "
        "(e.g., 'pricing', 'Q3 results'). This mimics 'Ctrl+F' and is 10x cheaper than scrolling.\n\n"
        "4. **STEP 3: SEQUENTIAL READING (`scroll_web_page`)**\n"
        "   - **CONDITION:** Only use if reading a narrative/story OR if Search returned no results.\n"
        "   - **WARNING:** Scrolling is expensive. Avoid unless absolutely necessary."

    "CONTEXT_MANAGEMENT": (
        "### 🧠 CONTEXT & MEMORY RULES:\n"
        "- **NO HALLUCINATIONS:** If a tool returns 'No results', do not invent information.\n"
        "- **SYNTHESIS:** Synthesize findings into natural language. Do not output raw JSON/Markdown.\n"
        "- **CITATION:** Always cite the source URL when providing facts."
    ),
    "RICH_MEDIA_HANDLING": (
        "### 🖼️ RICH MEDIA & IMAGES:\n"
        "- The 'read_web_page' tool will return Markdown images (e.g., ![Alt](url)).\n"
        "- **DO NOT remove these links.** Pass them through to the user so they can see the context.\n"
        "- If a video link appears (e.g., YouTube), explicitly mention it: 'I found a relevant video: [Title]'.\n"
